# HumanBodyPartSegNet

What this repository contains:
1) Google colab notebook containing the neural network for body part segmentation and code for matching poses between images
2) Modified matlab code from https://www.cs.stanford.edu/~roozbeh/pascal-parts/pascal-parts.html for getting all examples with peopple in them and creating segmentation masks with 7 classes for the desired limbs and background. The matlab code also creates an 80-20 split between training and test data.
